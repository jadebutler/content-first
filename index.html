<h2>About</h2>



<p>Georgia is a serif typeface designed in 1993 by Matthew Carter and hinted by
Tom Rickner for the Microsoft Corporation. It was intended as a serif font that
would appear elegant but legible printed small or on low-resolution screens.
The font is inspired by Scotch Roman designs of the 19th century and was based on designs
for a print typeface in the same style Carter was working on when contacted by Microsoft;
this would be released under the name Miller some years later.
<p> The typeface's name referred to a tabloid headline claiming "Alien heads found in
 Georgia."
 <p>
<p>
It features a large x-height (tall lower-case letters) and its thin strokes are
thicker than would be common on a typeface designed for display use or the greater
sharpness possible in print. Its reduced contrast and thickened serifs make it
somewhat resemble Clarendon designs from the 19th century.
<p>It was intended as a serif font that would appear elegant but legible printed
small or on low-resolution screens.
<p>
<p>Georgia's bold is also unusually bold, almost black. Carter noted that,
"Verdana and Georgia...were all about binary bitmaps: every pixel was on or off,
black or white. The bold versions of Verdana and Georgia are bolder than most bolds,
because on the screen, at the time we were doing this in the mid-1990s, if the stem wanted
to be thicker than one pixel, it could only go to two pixels. That is a bigger jump in
weight than is conventional in print series.
<p>

<p>
The Georgia typeface is similar to Times New Roman, another reimagination of transitional
 serif designs, but as a design for screen display it has a larger x-height and
 fewer fine details.

<h2> <center> Designer </h2>

<p>

Matthew Carter was born on October first 1937. He is a British type designer. His most used fonts are Verdana, Georgia and Tahoma. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
His typefaces are all across the stylistic spectrum, from elegant renaissance oldstyles  to sans-serifs. Carter says, “I can't think of a period in typography that I would rather be working in,” one realizes that he has grasped the implications of his own talent in its intersection with history. When asked what sustains his interest in typography, he offers this: “A font is always a struggle between the alphabetic nature of the letterform, the 'A-ness' of the A, and your desire to put some of yourself into the letterform. It's a struggle between representing something and trying to find some iota of yourself in it.”
<p>On May 26, 2011 Matthew Carter received a Lifetime Achievement Award
from the Smithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in part
 for design of Georgia font.
